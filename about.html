      <h2>Words from the gal herself</h2> <!-- Heading level 2 -->
      <p>"I like to take nice photo's of the nice places I visit. I don't know I'm really struggling to answer this. I first got into photography after looking back at my photos from a trip to Canada in 2019. This sparked an interest in wanting to capture the beauty of things around me."</p> <!-- Opening paragraph -->

      <h2>Art of Photography</h2> <!-- Heading level 2 -->
      <p>Photography has been around for centuries, from capturing moments of a jockey and his horse to capturing moments of pure beauty, finally someone who has mastered the art form and transcended what would typically be considered a good photo. FINALLY, someone has truly showed us what it means to take photos so the people below can grovel and kiss the feet of our one and true photo taking goddess. Bow down before her might, before she smites thee with a long and wide lens. Capturing both your weakened frail existence whilst simultaneously capturing her godlike essence.</p>

      <h2>The Land of Fire & Ice</h2> <!-- Heading level 2 -->
      <p>All of the locations in these photos were taken in Iceland. Known for it's relatively volatile environment, namely it's constantly active volcanoes and paired with it's also constant opposite frozen waters and glaciers (Hence the term "Land of Fire and Ice"), Iceland remains one of the most stunning yet also most dangerous countries in the world.</p> <!-- Opening paragraph -->
